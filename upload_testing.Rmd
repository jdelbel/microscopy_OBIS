Testing upload methods for new data

library(janitor) #Where do I use this? Test running without - removing empty rows/NArows
library(hutils) #Used to drop empty columns 
library(obistools) #Used for initial species matches to WoRMs - good for cleaning taxonomic names
library(worrms) #Used to derive accepted names and taxonomic hierarchies
library(curl) #??? Test running without.
