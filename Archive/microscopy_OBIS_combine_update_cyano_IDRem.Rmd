#Testing area to upload minimally formatted data sheet.
#Manual excel manipulation (could probably be done in R, but the sheets never come completely the same, so not sure if there is much point fully automating this):
#   1. Input hakai_id as first row (not provided in data sheet so need to add anyways)
#   2. Remove date and station name (hakai_id and depth top two rows - makes upload messy if kept)
#   3. Remove empty three rows between depth and data rows
#   4. Remove "m" after depth (can probably do this in R, but need to figure out regex language)
#   5. Remove empty columns between species name and abundance counts
#   6. Remove notes rows at bottom (always messy and split over multiple rows, makes my columns characters)
#Ideally I could just put a bunch of csv files into a folder, upload together all at once and spit out formatted combined sheet, but is it possible with how the data arrives?
