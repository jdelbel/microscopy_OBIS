#Testing area to upload minimally formatted data sheet.
#Manual excel manipulation (could probably be done in R, but the sheets never come completely the same, so not sure if there is much point fully automating this):
#   1. Input hakai_id as first row (not provided in data sheet so need to add anyways)
#   2. Remove date and station name (hakai_id and depth top two rows - makes upload messy if kept)
#   3. Remove empty three rows between depth and data rows
#   4. Remove "m" after depth (can probably do this in R, but need to figure out regex language)
#   5. Remove empty columns between species name and abundance counts
#   6. Remove notes rows at bottom (always messy and split over multiple rows, makes my columns characters)
#Ideally I could just put a bunch of csv files into a folder, upload together all at once and spit out formatted combined sheet, but is it possible with how the data arrives?

When I downloaded the SHARK dataset from OBIS (http://ipt.vliz.be/eurobis/resource?r=shark_phytoplankton), there were multiple instances with duplicate species.

The match taxa tool appears to work when sp. or spp. are present, it just removed the abbreviations, so they will need to be parsed out into a separate column in the final datasheet, so this information is retained. The tool throws NAs when non-species names are included, so may actually be good to leave these in so I can identify them.

#OBIS matching tool to QC names and assign WoRMS scientificNameID. Match types are as follows (http://www.marinespecies.org/tutorial_taxonmatch.php):
#'*1. exact - all characters match exactly*
#'*2. exact_subgenus - an exact match, but including the subgenus*
#'*3. phonetic - sounds similar as, despite minor differences in spelling (soundex algorithm)*
#'*4. near_1 - perfect match, except for one character. This is a quite reliable match*
#'*5. near_2 - good match, except for two characters. This needs an extra check*
#'*6. near_3 - good match, except for three characters. This definitely needs an extra check*
#'*7. match_quarantine - match with a name that is currently in quarantine. Any name that has been used in the literature should in principle not be quarantined. So best to contact the WoRMS DMT about this*
#'*8. match_deleted - this is a match with a name that has been deleted and no alternative is available. Please contact the WoRMS DMT when you come across this.*
#When placed in-line does not show options for multiple matched. Must be done in console and once known, number can be used with in-line code.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
