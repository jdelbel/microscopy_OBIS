Testing upload methods for new data - Unfortunately, changes need to be made for each new data sheet. I'm conflicted as to whether some of these changes could be done more quickly manually within excel.

```{r}
#Load packages - Ran script with some packages turned off and it work, but need to try with more
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor) #Where do I use this? Test running without - removing empty rows/NArows
library(hutils) #Used to drop empty columns 
library(obistools) #Used for initial species matches to WoRMs - good for cleaning taxonomic names
library(worrms) #Used to derive accepted names and taxonomic hierarchies
library(curl) #??? Test running without.
library(stringr) #Used to remove white-space after 
library(here)
library(readxl)
```

```{r}
#Uploading data with no headers as header information spread over multiple rows - goal is go get HakaiID as header. Better to use read_csv, but doesn't work for transpose stage later as I have it set for a data frame, not tibble. Will fix, but works as it is for now.
micro <- read_xlsx(here("files", "Calvert_phyto.xlsx"), sheet = "KC10_3")

#Thinks this works - replaces read.csv commented out above. Caused errors in Notes DF

#removing empty rows and columns 
micro <- micro %>% 
  janitor::remove_empty()

#Rename first column as species as contains species information
# micro <- micro %>%
#   rename(species = Ã¯..species)

#This dataset was pre-formatted - renaming group column

#   rename(group = X)
```

#Commented out here because group was already pre-formatted for this sheet.

I do this work here, because I can use Louis' groupings to help guide the new names. Note, unidentified diatoms with size designations are not dealt with her, so species_fix will show NAs.  Fixed later when data transposed and then size groups are summed and the new column is renamed. Unknown cells/non-flagellated cells also not dealt with as data are not carried forward (species_fix will show NA, these data removed later). This list/fixes can grow and include terms not included in the datasheet and will still work - become more encompassing, but be sure to cross-check
